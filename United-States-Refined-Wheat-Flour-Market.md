This sector includes the production of bread, cakes, pastries, cookies, and other baked goods. Refined wheat flour is favored for its ability to create the desired texture and consistency in bakery products, as it contributes to their softness, elasticity, and moisture retention. With an increasing demand for convenience foods and premium bakery products, the refined wheat flour market for bakery applications is experiencing significant growth. Furthermore, the rising popularity of health-conscious, organic, and gluten-free bakery products is encouraging flour producers to innovate and offer specialty flours that cater to these consumer preferences. <p>The bakery segment is also being influenced by the growing trend of artisanal and craft baking, which emphasizes the use of high-quality ingredients and traditional baking methods. As consumer tastes evolve, bakery products are becoming more diverse, with a wider variety of flavors, textures, and dietary options available. This trend is leading to an increasing demand for refined wheat flour tailored for specific uses in artisanal, health-oriented, and ready-to-eat bakery products. Moreover, the growth of online food delivery platforms and home-based baking activities has further accelerated demand for bakery-related refined wheat flour, contributing to the segment’s overall expansion.<h2>Pasta Segment</h2><p>The pasta industry represents another significant application of refined wheat flour in the U.S. market.
